==========

To translate human ventricular cell model by ten Tusscher in 2006 from cpp to matlab.

The original code and paper can be find [here](http://www-binf.bio.uu.nl/khwjtuss/SourceCodes/).

This model uses the ODE solver provided by the MATLAB, so it's faster and clearer than the original code written in cpp.
